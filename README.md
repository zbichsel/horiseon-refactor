# horiseon-refactor

## Description

Horiseon is a webpage in which the user can learn more about **search engine optimization**, **online reputation management**, and **social media marketing**.

I restructured the code into **Semantic HTML** by selecting the division in the HTML and rendering them into appropriate elements, then I moved over to the **CSS** and consolidated code to free up space and remove repitition. The links work at the top of the page in so far as to move the user down to the individual topics listed.
